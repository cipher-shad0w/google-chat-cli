gogchat is a fast, full-featured CLI and TUI for the Google Chat API. Manage spaces, send messages, handle reactions, upload media, and more — all without leaving your terminal. A companion TUI provides a rich, interactive chat experience built with Python and Textual.

## Features

- **Terminal UI** — interactive chat interface with space navigation, message editing, reactions, and desktop notifications
- **JSON output** — structured output for scripting and automation (`--json`)
- **OAuth2 authentication** — browser-based login with built-in credentials; no setup required
- **Admin operations** — manage spaces and members as a Workspace admin (`--admin`)
- **Media upload & download** — attach and retrieve files from messages
- **Custom emoji** — create, list, and manage custom emoji for your organization
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Linux, and Windows; amd64 and arm64

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

```bash
brew tap cipher-shad0w/tap
brew install gogchat
```

### Prebuilt binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cipher-shad0w/gogchat/releases).

### Build from source

Requires Go 1.25+:

```bash
go install github.com/cipher-shad0w/gogchat/cmd/gogchat@latest
```

> **Note:** When building from source, you must supply your own Google OAuth2 credentials.

### TUI

The terminal UI is available as a standalone binary via Homebrew, or as a Python package.

#### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install cipher-shad0w/tap/gogchat-tui
```

This installs a self-contained binary — no Python required.

#### pip / uv

Alternatively, install from PyPI (requires Python 3.10+):

```bash
pip install gogchat-tui
```

Or with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv tool install gogchat-tui
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Authenticate with your Google account
gogchat auth login

# List your spaces
gogchat spaces list

# Send a message
gogchat messages send spaces/SPACE_ID --text "Hello from the CLI!"

# List members of a space
gogchat members list spaces/SPACE_ID

# Add a reaction
gogchat reactions add spaces/SPACE_ID/messages/MSG_ID --emoji "👍"

# Upload a file
gogchat media upload spaces/SPACE_ID --file ./report.pdf
```

## Terminal UI

Launch the interactive chat interface:

```bash
gogchat-tui

The TUI provides a full chat experience — space navigation, message display with rich text, inline reactions, message editing and deletion, a reaction picker, space management, desktop notifications, and local caching.
